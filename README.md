The Food ordering app shows a list of meals (dummy data) and their prices. Selected items will be sent to a cart for reviewing and checkout. Once the order is made, it will then be stored in Firebase, a real-time database. This also makes the application serverless where the client can have direct access to the resources without the need of backend server. React and Redux toolkits were used to build the app with emphasis on state management as well as compact, reusable components.
